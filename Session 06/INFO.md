### Tasks:
1. How to sort dictionary by keys
2. Compare between Adjacency Matrix/List
3. How does DFS and BFS work
4. Create your own library and use it
5. Create a function receives stack elements as inputs from user while not equal to zero
6. Implement Unordered/Multi set in Python

### Notes:
* Graph traversal algorithms are DFS and BFS
* Priority Queue order Ascending in Python and Descending in C++
* Enter numeric inputs negatively to reverse order in priority queue
