## Adjacency Matrix vs. Adjacency List
|#              |Adjacency Matrix               |Adjacency List                 |
|---            |---                            |---                            |

## BFS vs. DFS
|#              |BFS                    |DFS                    |
|---            |---                    |---                    |
|Name           |Breadth First Search   |Depth First Search     |
|Use            |Queue                  |Stack                  |
|Time           |O (V+E)                |O (V+E)                |

### Conclusion
> BFS is better to be used if target is far from starting point. <br />
> DFS is better to be used in decision trees.
